Building a horror base filled with skullspikes and gibbets was one of the most spoopylicious possibilities in Ideology, but it turned out terror was never needed and redundant with the collar and body strap. In addition, the way terror worked was janky at best, slow to apply because the observation check has a low tick rate, yet quick to fade when the 5 cell observation range gets surpassed. So I changed it!
   
Primary Changes:
Give terror a non-redundant benefit, and make it less janky:
1. Terror can be used to weaken or nullify the "weapon proximity", "escape route", and "unattended" rebellion penalties. Meaning that outdoor work, hauling/smelting in the armory, assisting in fighting, or even leaving the map with all your colonists is now possible as long as there is sufficient terror coverage.
2. The terror object observation will remain for 4 in-game hours instead of immediately ending once out of the 5 cell range of the terror object.

Smarter suppression logic:
1. Wardens will suppress when suppression is under 90%, up from 70%.
2. If suppression loss per day is 0%, wardens will suppress if suppression is under 100%.

New heart acidifier implant:
1. A mini-acidifier installed next to the heart to instill permanent terror in slaves. Causes a slave to have 100% terror anywhere in the world regardless of terror objects. Unlocked by the Bionic Replacements research.

Terror values adjusted, because there was no reason to use Gibbets or Terror sculptures over the cheaper and better Skullspikes.
1. Gibbet buffed to 50 terror, up from 25 terror.
2. Terror sculpture buffed to 40 terror, up from 10 terror, +-5 per quality difference.
3. Skullspikes are now lightweight objects like Torches, so they can be placed in sand/swampy terrain, over stockpile zones, won't block wind turbines, and be easily walked over.
4. Placing/selecting terror structures will now show the terror radius.

The combined effect is that terror will both serve a unique role and be an important consideration in base design. Just in time for Halloween!

*Near 0% performance impact (0.001ms average in Dubs Performance Analyzer).
*Safe to add mid-game.
*Not recommended to remove mid-game due to heart acidifier dependency.
*Confirmed compatible with CE, Vanilla Expanded series, Alpha series, and Humanoid Alien Races.
*No other known incompatibilies.

~2.01 update: Fixed Heart Acidifier to not be dependent on owning Royalty.
~2.0 update: 
- Now compatible with 1.4! 
- New Heart Acidifier implant!
- Terror observation effect will now remain for 4 in-game hours, up from 1 hour. This should feel better gameplay wise and will allow for nicer base design, rather than requiring terror coverage for every inch of the base. 
- Smart logic to ensure wardens maintain 100% suppression if suppression loss per day is 0%.
- Removed the nerfs to Body straps and Collar, because it was over-complexity and bloat for no real gameplay improvement.
~1.02 update: Removed the meditation focus radius indicator from terror sculptures because double radius indicators is too confusing.
~1.01 update: Added terror radius indicator when placing/selecting terror structures.
